Gomoku or Go-moku or Five in line, is a traditional oriental game, originally from China. In Japanese language Go means five, and moku pieces (or eyes or dots).

Black plays first, and players alternate in placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to get an unbroken row of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
